  - `docs: update documentation`
  - `refactor: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature`
  - `chore: maintenance or tooling changes`
- Example: `fix: handle missing threats file gracefully`

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Use a descriptive PR title summarizing your change.
- The PR title should follow the same format as commit messages.
- Fill out the PR template checklist.
- Ensure your PR description explains the context and reasoning for the change.

## Review Process
- All PRs require at least one approving review.
- PRs with unclear commit messages or titles may be asked to update before merging.
